# Quest Forge — Decision Log

Settled design decisions, with the reasoning. **Check this before redesigning or
re-proposing** — these were argued once already. If a decision needs revisiting, do it
explicitly with the human, then update the entry (don't silently contradict it).

Format: date · decision · why. Newest first.

**2026-06-14 · The campaign premise is pinned canon, and the game opens with a DM scene —
not a blank box.** The opening scenario the player authors at adventure start is stored in
`session.premise` and injected as a never-pruned `## CAMPAIGN PREMISE` block (DM rule 8
treats it as binding as world facts). This closes a real gap: the journal summarizer keeps
*what happened in-scene* and compresses away player-asserted setup, and the player's raw
message is never embedded into RAG — so player-authored canon (a home city, a backstory)
could be forgotten once the message window slid past. Pinning the premise also fixes the
weakest UX moment: instead of an empty "type something to begin" box, the DM auto-opens the
first scene from the premise (ChatPanel priming, extended to fresh games). Premise is
optional — leave it blank and the classic manual-start flow remains. Capture is a dedicated
field (not auto-grabbing the first chat message): explicit, and the player knows exactly
what's permanent. Importing player canon into RAG is a separate, still-open backstop (IDEAS.md).

**2026-06-12 · Roster entries are heroes, not campaigns — and imports are rebuilt, not
trusted.** The character roster (`characterVault.js` + IndexedDB `characters` store)
snapshots `character` + `inventory` only; campaigns stay the save system's job. Import
files are hand-editable JSON, so identity fields are validated/clamped and every derived
field (proficiency, saves, traits, features, resources, hit dice) is rebuilt from
race/class data — the DM↔engine trust rule applied to files. Heroes start roster
adventures rested (full HP, fresh resources); importing into an *ongoing* campaign was
deliberately excluded (tangles combat state, DM context, and XP coherence).

**2026-06-11 · Test-play with Fighter only for now.** Magic classes need real design work
(spell slots, curated lists, theater-of-mind area handling) — see IDEAS.md "Spellcasting".
Rogue is the agreed next class when the fighter phase ends. Don't build caster mechanics ad hoc.

**2026-06-11 · Campaign structure = hidden "fronts", not generated act outlines.** Acts
produce generic, railroady plots. Fronts (hidden threats with goals that advance off-screen
and leak symptoms) preserve player agency while making the world feel alive. Design in
IDEAS.md before implementation.

**2026-06-10 · Autosaves are local-per-device BY DESIGN; cloud carries manual saves only.**
"Continue" always resumes *this device's* session. A shared cloud autosave slot meant
newest-device-wins could silently bury another device's progress. Manual saves sync to
Firestore and are visible everywhere when signed in. (`GameContext.jsx` autosave does not
push to cloud; this is intentional, not a bug.)

**2026-06-10 · Cloud doc ID for the autosave slot is `autosave`, never `__autosave__`.**
Firestore REJECTS document IDs matching `__*__` ("reserved"). This silently broke cloud
autosave for 4 months. The mapping lives at the `cloudSync.js` boundary; callers still pass
`__autosave__`. Local IndexedDB keeps the legacy slot name.

**2026-06-10 · Cloud failures must be visible.** Every cloud path used to swallow errors
(catch → return false/[]/null) while the toast claimed success. Save feedback now reports
where the save landed (local vs cloud vs failed). Never reintroduce silent cloud failure.

**2026-06 (laptop) · Player-facing dice are crypto-random, never Math.random().** The
"LLM can't cheat the dice" guarantee. `dice.ts` is the only roll source for gameplay.

**2026-06 (laptop) · `LOAD_GAME` preserves live `user` and merges current `settings`.**
Loading a save must never wipe the login or API keys with the save's stale snapshot
(old saves don't even store `user`). Regression here silently kills cloud sync for the session.

**~2026-04 · Core content set is 4 races / 4 classes** (human/elf/dwarf/halfOrc ×
fighter/wizard/rogue/cleric). The 8-race/6-class roster was deliberately trimmed in the
balance overhaul to give each option a distinct, polished niche. Don't re-add cut content
without a balance pass.

**Standing · The DM narrates; the engine owns mechanics.** All dice, HP/XP/AC math, leveling,
death saves, condition effects, and purchases are client-side. If the DM "should" do math,
the answer is a JSON event + engine code, not prompt instructions. (See CLAUDE.md for the
full contract.)
