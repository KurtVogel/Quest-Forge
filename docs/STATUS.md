# Quest Forge - Current Status

One-screen answer to "what's been in the works lately?" for any agent starting a fresh
session. **Update this at the end of any session that ships or decides something** —
replace stale entries, don't let it grow. For deeper history run `git log --oneline -20`.

_Last updated: 2026-06-23 (NPC roster promotion gating)_

## Current focus — memory & fronts real-play tuning

Fighter and Rogue combat mechanics are in good shape. **Wizard/Cleric spellcasting stays
parked** until the LLM memory layer (fronts, story memory, RAG, journal, location recall)
feels excellent in live play — casters multiply engine surface area; polish the money-maker first.

**Next gate:** a keyed **20–30 turn** campaign pass with `npm run eval:memory` (requires
`GEMINI_API_KEY` in the shell and the dev server at `http://localhost:5173`). Watch for:

- Front **symptoms** surfacing every few scenes without exposition or double-advancement
- **Story-memory callbacks** feeling natural (not on-the-nose, not absent)
- **Location-transition recall** after moving between named places
- **Journal cadence** (~10 messages) pruning without losing premise or recent arrivals
- **Roleplay-check proposals** remaining fair; Scribe roll audit catching bad setups
- Console clean; autosave intact after front-only or combat changes

## Recently shipped (June 21–23, 2026)

- **NPC roster promotion gating (2026-06-23):** generic combat fodder no longer enters the durable
  NPC list; legacy saves grandfather every existing NPC as a **character** (your starting-town
  captain stays). Prompt injection curates by importance/pins/location/tension instead of recency
  alone; Scribe/journal/DM instructions classify `character|creature|ephemeral`; relationship
  tension auto-promotes story-memory cards; Journal UI adds Pin/Archive + Characters/Archived tabs;
  RAG favors `npc_character` over narrative noise.
- **Location-transition history (2026-06-23):** journal entries carry `location`; the DM prompt
  gets a deterministic `## LOCATION TRANSITION HISTORY` block for "what happened right before
  I arrived here?" New journal chunks seed into RAG mid-session instead of only on reload.
- **Natural 20 out-of-combat (2026-06-23):** engine flags critical success on d20=20; DM prompt
  instructs an exceptional benefit beyond mere success (no mechanical inflation).
- **Rogue v1 combat (2026-06-23):** Expertise picker at creation; Sneak Attack damage in
  `combatExchange.js`; Cunning Action slot validation (dash/disengage/stealth + main action);
  Uncanny Dodge halves the first hit per exchange at level 5+. Automated playtest script added.
- **Scribe-audited roll policy (2026-06-22):** semantic out-of-combat roll gating and prose-roll
  extraction via background Scribe; local regex fallback offline.
- **Discussable roleplay checks (2026-06-22):** reload-safe proposal card — Roll / Challenge once /
  Change approach — before any out-of-combat dice.
- **Premise + fiction-first tuning (2026-06-22):** 8k premise, `starting_items` reconciliation,
  player-portrayal roll guard, NPC name diversity blocklist, solo DC ladder 8/10/12/15/18+.
- **Fronts v2 (2026-06-21):** generated multi-front campaigns, established-campaign upgrade,
  cadence-driven background movement, autosave on front-only changes. See git log for combat
  catalog fixes, quest idempotency, xAI CSP, and Combat v2 exchange machine history.

## Verification

- `npm test` — **325** tests passing (39 files)
- `npm run lint` — clean
- `npm run build` — green (~884 KB JS main chunk; split deferred pre-public)
- Real-provider gates: `npm run eval:combat`, `npm run eval:memory` (shell API keys required)

## Up next (agreed order)

1. **Keyed memory/fronts tuning pass** — run `eval:memory`, note failures, tune salience/symptoms
2. **Memory debug inspector** — dev/settings panel for story cards, RAG hits, curated injection,
   fronts clocks (normally hidden). See IDEAS.md. High interest for perfecting the memory layer.
3. **Rogue real-play feedback** — light pass after memory tuning; Sneak Attack/Cunning Action feel
4. **Wizard/Cleric spellcasting** — after memory layer is proven in live campaigns
5. **PWA + public launch** — separate project (API keys, Firebase, payments); not now
